<h1>JMock auto container</h1>
<h2>Inspired by .net automocking containers</h2>

<p>This container provides a relatively easy way to instantiate classes
where all dependencies are satisfied with their jmock mocked values.
This allows for faster writing of unit tests reflecting a development
environment where an IOC container is being used</p>

<p>While any mocking framework could have been used, jmock was selected
by the author.  Future contributions could provide support for other
mocking frameworks</p>
